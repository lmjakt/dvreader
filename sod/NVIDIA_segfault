With certain Nvidia drivers and cards, dimSqueezer may segfault during the mapping process.

This seems to be related to a bug in the Nvidia driver that has been observed with a range of
applications. A backtrace of the resulting core dump gave the following:

Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x00007ff0c8171a08 in _nv007tls () from /usr/lib64/tls/libnvidia-tls.so.290.10
(gdb) bt

#3  0x00007ff0c844f10d in clone () from /lib64/libc.so.6


Doing:

export __GL_SINGLE_THREADED=1

seems to cure this problem, but that might cause other issues elsewhere.

Hopefully this will be sorted.

Maybe I can implement some sort of wrapper script to start the application. Hmm

############ SOLVED #################

This issue has been solved by updating the Nvidia driver to the latest version.
Note that the one in the openSUSE 12.1 repository has this problem, and I had to
do a manual install. This is not difficult, but it's important to remember that
the reinstall needs to be carried out after each upgrade of the system.
